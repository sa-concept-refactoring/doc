= Refactoring â€” #refactoring_name <inline_concept_requirement>
For the first refactoring a subset of the initial idea (@idea_requirement_transformation) is implemented.
Specifically the inlining of an explicit ```cpp requires``` clause into a constrained function template.
@capabilities_of_first_refactoring shows some examples of what this refactoring is able to do.

A detailed analysis can be found in @first_refactoring_analysis.
Implementation details are discussed in @first_refactoring_implementation
and limitations are explored in @limitations_of_first_refactoring.
Finally, the usage of the refactoring is shown in @first_refactoring_usage.

== Analysis <first_refactoring_analysis>
The analysis will look at which elements need to be captured (@first_refactoring_captured_elements) and how the refactoring transforms the AST (@first_refactoring_ast_analysis).

=== Captured Elements <first_refactoring_captured_elements>
@first_refactoring_captured_elements_figure shows the captured elements and their purpose.
A reference to them is stored as a member of the tweak object during the preparation phase and used during the application phase.

    template <typename T>
              ^^^^^^^^^^
    void f(T) requires foo<T> {}
    ```,
    [
      *Template Type Parameter Declaration* \
      Will be updated using the concept found in the concept specialization expression below.

=== Abstract Syntax Tree <first_refactoring_ast_analysis>
The AST gives a good overview over the structure of the code before and after the refactoring.
In @first_refactoring_ast the AST trees of a simple template method and its corresponding refactored version are shown.

Looking at the original version (on the left) it is visible that the outermost `FunctionTemplate` contains the template type parameters, as well as the function definition.
The `requires` clause is represented by a `ConceptSpecialization` with a corresponding `Concept reference`.

During the refactor operation most of the AST stays untouched, except for the concept reference (in yellow), which gets moved to the template type parameter and the concept specialization, which gets removed (in red).

After looking at this we came to the conclusion that we can look out for `ConceptSpecialization` nodes to determine if the refactoring applies and then do further analysis.

      a.abc();

    [],

    template<Foo T>
    void bar(T a) {
      a.abc();
    }
    ```,

== Implementation <first_refactoring_implementation>
The implementation itself was mostly straight-forward, that is once we figured out how to traverse the AST.
Discovery was made a bit hard by the fact that some methods we required were global and some required casting.
Looking at the existing refactorings helped a lot during this time. 

The biggest hurdle of this refactoring was the `requires` keyword itself,
which was quite hard to track down as it is not part of the AST itself.
To figure out where exaclty it is located in the source code it was necessary to resort to the token representation of the source range.

  === Testing
  A lot of manual tests were performed using a test project.
  Debug inspections were performed often to verify assumptions.
  Unit tests were also written as described in @testing, which consist of a total of 11 tests, 4 of them availability tests, 4 unavailability tests and 3 application tests.
  This is a similar extent to which existing refactorings are tested.

  === Pull Request
  The implementation has been submitted upstream as a pull request @pull_request_of_first_refactoring and as of #datetime.today().display("[month repr:long] [year]") is awaiting review.

== Limitations <limitations_of_first_refactoring>
To keep the scope of the implementation managable it was decided to leave some features out.
These limitations however could be lifted in a future version.
The implementation is built so it actively looks for these patterns and does not offer the refactoring operation if one is present.

=== Combined Concept Requirements
Handling combined `requires` clauses would certainly be possible,
however it would increase the complexity of the refactoring code significantly.
Since working on the LLVM project is new for all participants, it was decided that this feature will be left out.
#figure(
  ```cpp
  template <typename T, typename U>
  requires foo<T> && foo<U>
  void f(T)
  ```,
  caption: "Combined concept requirement",
)

=== Class Templates
Handling class templates would not have been a big stretch,
however the testing involved to make sure it works correctly would have taken a significant amount of time.
To keep the momentum going this was not implemented.
#figure(
  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  requires foo<T>
  class Bar;
  ```,
  caption: "Class template",
)

=== Multiple Type Arguments
If a concept has multiple type arguments, such as ```cpp std::convertible_to<T, U>``` the refactoring will not be applicable.
The complexity of handling this is quite big and the potential use case so small, that it was decided to not provide the capability.
#figure(
  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  requires std::convertible_to<int, T>
  void f(T)
  ```,
  caption: "Function template with multiple type arguments",
)

== Usage <first_refactoring_usage>
The refactoring is available as a code action to language server clients.
// TODO: document where the refactoring option is available when right clicking

=== VS Code
To use the feature the user needs to hover over the requires clause (e.g. `std::integral<T>`),
then right click to show the code options.
To see the possible refactorings the option "Refactor..." needs to be clicked and then the newly implemented refactoring "Inline concept requirement" will appear within the listed options.
How this can look like is shown in @inline_concept_requirement_usage_in_vs_code.

  ],
) <inline_concept_requirement_usage_in_vs_code>

=== Neovim
@first_refactoring_usage_in_vim shows how the refactoring looks like before accepting it in Neovim.
The cursor needs to be placed on the requires clause before triggering the listing of code actions.
