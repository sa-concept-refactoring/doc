=== Personal Report - Vina Zahnd

Contributing to a open source project like LLVM was a great experience even though the changes are not yet merged.
For me this was the first time to work on an open source project and I learned a lot while doing so.

At first it seemed to be a very difficult project work with but we were able to get it to work quickly.
I was struggling a lot with building the project in the beginning as it took a lot of memory to do so and would end in errors. 
After a few trials I decided to not close my notebook anymore until it has builded completely which worked out in the end.
Writing the code itself required a lot of trial and error as well as reading the clangd documentation.
When the refactoring feature was finally displaying in the VSCode editor it felt like a huge achievement.

The documentation part of this project was hard to get into and included a lot of procrastination.
We were struggling a lot with the structure of the documentation and what content we should include.

Jeremy and I were a good team and got along really good.
When ever we had a disagreement we wre able to solve it in a good manner.
As Jeremy is more experienced in C++ he needed to help me from time to time and was way faster then me in making development progress.
He explained certain things which was a good addition to my knowledge and was appreciated.

Our supervisor was always friendly and helpful at all time.
We had good discussions within our weekly meeting and I felt to be in good hands. 

My personal highlight was when we first got comments on our Pull Request.
The reviewer left us some very good comments and wrote that he is looking forward to having the new refactoring feature within the project.

To conclude, it was a good project overall and a good addition to my career and I'm even motivated to contribute further to the clangd language server or any other open source project.
